# coverlist

coverlist is a YouTube music player that creates **nested** playlists which is great for people who listen to many music covers.

### Example
As an example, you want to listen to multiple covers of Bill Wither's  **Lean On Me**:

| Artist | YouTube URL |
| --- | --- |
|Bill Withers (original)|...|
|Glee|...|
|Kirk Franklin|...|

And many covers of **Lost** by Frank Ocean:

| Artist | YouTube URL |
| --- | --- |
|Frank Ocean (original)|...|
|Jorja Smith|...|
|Khalid|...|
|MÃ˜|...|

coverlist will make sure covers of the same song will never be played one after the other. 
coverlist picks one **Lean On Me** cover and then picks a random cover of **Lost** upon completion.

## Try it Out

This is a **work in progress** and is built during my spare time. Feel free to try it out! A live demo can be found via one of the sources below:
